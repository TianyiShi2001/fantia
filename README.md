# Fantia Download & Sync Tool

This main goal of this tool is to sync all currently visible contents from the fanclubs you're following to your local machine, which is particularly useful when you end a paid subscription and want to view previously available contents.

This initially designed as an executable. Use this package as a library at your own risk, as the API is not stable.

### Dealing with Paid Content

After the initial sync of a fanclub, the date and the subscription fee are recorded. Every time this fanclub is to be synced again, your new subscription fee is checked against the previous recorded subscription fee. If it increases, all posts will be checked for potential new contents, which will be downloaded.
